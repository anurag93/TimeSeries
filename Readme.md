\f0\fs24 \cf0 Time Series Analysis\
	-We have Notebooks and data consisting of various time series applications.\
	-We analyze various statistical and deep learning models in the space of time series analysis.\
	-The statistical model covers topics in time series properties and how they are important for 	  Analyzing and choosing the best model.\
	-Deep Learning model explores the reach of LSTM in time series forecasting.}
